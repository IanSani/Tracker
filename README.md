Behaviour Driven Development{
1. When a user inputs 0 as a value for the side of the triangle,the app will output not a triangle.
2. When a user inputs values such as 9,4,3 that cannot form a triangle,the app will output not a triangle to inform them
3. A user connot enter text as the only input type is categorised as number.}
